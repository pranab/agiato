agiato is a simple no frill Cassandra NOSQL database API. My goal has been to make sure that
it does not take someone more than hour to learn the API and start using it.

It DOES thew following

- Supports Cassandra version .7x
- Simple wrapper around thrift API
- API does not support different data types. 
- An Util class is provided for conversion between ByteBuffer and basic data types
- API only understands ByteBuffer
- The api is defined in one class
- There is database connection pooling using appached common pool library
- There is simple round robin load balancer.
- User defined load balancer can be plugged in
- There is JSON file that defined cluster, connection configuration and key space definition
- The API load the JSON on start up and creates the key space if necessary

It DOES NO DO the following

- Object mapping
- Data types

It WILL DO the following in future

- Support named query and index defined in the JSON file
